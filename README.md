# Interactive-Java-Projects
This repository showcases a collection of interactive Java applications developed to enhance problem-solving skills and understanding of classic computational problems. Each project is implemented in Java and demonstrates various algorithms and game strategies.

Projects Included
Knights Tour (Knites.java): An implementation of the Knight's Tour problem, where the knight visits every square on a chessboard exactly once.

Maze Solver (Maze.java): A program that finds a path through a maze from a starting point to an endpoint using depth-first search.

Maze Solver with Obstacles (Maze_With_Obsticle.java): An extension of the maze solver that accounts for additional obstacles, providing a more complex pathfinding challenge.

N-Queens Problem (Queens.java): Solves the N-Queens problem, which involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

Sudoku Solver (Suduko_Solver.java): A solver for Sudoku puzzles that fills in the missing numbers in a 9×9 grid while adhering to Sudoku rules.

Tic-Tac-Toe (Tic_Tac_Toe.java): A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation allowing two players to compete against each other.
